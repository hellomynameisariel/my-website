Turning a big-budget beautification project into a streamlined, resident-led success story started with one thing: smart research and better planning.

As part of the Beautification Committee for our HOA, I developed a detailed proposal to enhance the buildingâ€™s shared outdoor spaces. While collaborating with the committee, I independently researched, sourced, and organized all furniture recommendations across six different areas of the property. The final proposal included curated product selections, visual references, live shopping links, and Augmented Reality renderings to make the concepts accessible for both technical and non-technical members.

## Key Contributions

- Conducted independent research to identify durable, cost-effective furniture options appropriate for a coastal environment and heavy shared use.
- Compiled product details, prices, and vendor links into a cohesive and navigable proposal document.
- Created simple AR renderings to allow committee members to preview potential layouts in context.
- Balanced visual appeal, function, and cost efficiency to maximize the impact of the project while respecting budget limitations.

## Research Highlights

- Proposed upgrades for six underutilized common areas, each tailored to different light levels, usage patterns, and aesthetics.
- Sourced modular furniture to allow flexible layouts depending on resident needs and seasonal changes.
- Through independent research and planning, I helped cut projected costs by over 80%, allowing the committee to meet its beautification goals without sacrificing quality or design standards.

## Reflections

This project challenged me to think like both a user and a planner, ensuring that every recommendation worked for a wide range of residents, not just on paper but in day-to-day living. By combining clear research, practical visualization tools, and early stakeholder input, we were able to make faster, more confident decisions that moved the beautification project forward without needing to over-rely on external consultants.
