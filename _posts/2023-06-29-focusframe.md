Sometimes the hardest part is just starting.

I built **FocusFrame** to help a teammate who felt overwhelmed by an endless to-do list.  
The idea was simple: break big tasks into timeboxed 15-minute sprints to make progress feel visible and achievable.

FocusFrame is a lightweight tool built using pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript — no libraries, no frameworks, no distractions.
