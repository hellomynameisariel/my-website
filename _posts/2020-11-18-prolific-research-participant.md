## Project Overview

Since November 18, 2020, I’ve been an active research participant on **Prolific**, a platform connecting researchers with vetted contributors. Over the years, I’ve completed more than **150 approved studies** — everything from behavioral science experiments to political surveys to vision tests — for universities (including quite a few Ivy League names), research labs, and companies around the world.

## Key Contributions

- Kept a spotless record across hundreds of attention checks, quality screens, and research protocols — Prolific doesn’t make it easy.
- Represented a reliable data point for high-level academic and private sector research, maintaining eligibility for exclusive and invite-only studies.
- Picked up firsthand knowledge about what makes good research design (and bad research design) from the participant’s perspective.

## Research Highlights

- Topics have included YouTube engagement patterns, political opinion modeling, vision and perception tests, and even quirky one-off experiments.
- Worked across a huge range of study types: timed experiments, video-based tasks, longitudinal surveys, and UX testing.
- Helped fuel large-scale datasets used by major institutions to push forward behavioral science, political research, and digital media studies.

## Reflections

What started as a casual side project turned into a long-term deep dive into how research actually gets made — and how much hinges on careful participant feedback.  
Keeping my account in good standing for this long wasn’t just about showing up; it was about consistently bringing accuracy, focus, and a little bit of humanity into every data point.
