Comparing AI headshot generators goes beyond testing features. I designed a complete benchmark framework to capture where each platform succeeded, struggled, or surprised.

Given minimal initial direction and no preset parameters, I developed and executed a full comparison framework to evaluate each tool's real-world performance across multiple user-facing and technical dimensions.

My process included:

- Researching and selecting 8 competitive AI platforms without external constraint
- Developing a custom set of evaluation metrics, including price-per-image, processing time, image quality, upload requirements, and platform stability
- Uploading consistent reference data and generating new outputs for each platform
- Compiling both technical specifications (file size, dimensions, ppi) and user experience notes
- Creating an individual detailed post for each tool covering workflow, output samples, feature strengths, and challenges
- Building a comparative chart summarizing results across all platforms

Where raw user experience data was non-numerical, I created standardized fields to measure issues like "best feature," "worst feature," and "site problems" in a structured, scorable format.

The final comparison spanned more than 30 unique metrics per platform and surfaced real-world tradeoffs beyond simple marketing claims â€” including pricing transparency, output quality, system stability, and workflow efficiency.
