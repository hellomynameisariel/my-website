# FiftyFlow

FiftyFlow is a lightweight Pomodoro-style timer designed for deeper focus. It’s pre-set to 50-minute work sessions and 10-minute recovery breaks — no logins, no ads, just flow.

I made this for myself and my team when we wanted something better than generic timers that either distract, overcomplicate, or try to gamify focus. FiftyFlow respects your time and attention.

## Why I Built It

Most timer apps want you to create accounts, track streaks, or jump through setup hoops. We just wanted to work, rest, and repeat — with visual cues that signaled transitions and enough customization to make it ours. FiftyFlow is my take on that: minimalist, flexible, and respectful of the user.

## Features

- **Built-in 50/10 structure**: Inspired by peak cognitive rhythm research
- **Background shift cues**: Break color shifts help snap attention
- **1-minute red alert**: Pre-end visual cue for breaks
- **Resize + pop-out mode**: Great for dual monitors or clean desktops
- **Chime free**: No audio alert to startle

## How it Reflects My Approach

FiftyFlow reflects how I approach problem-solving: listen to what real people need, strip away the noise, and build something that works without getting in the way. It’s simple because it should be.

## Future Enhancements

- Customizable interval presets (e.g., 25/5 or 90/20)
- Local storage of last used settings
- Optional daily timer summary
