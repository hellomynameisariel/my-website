A simple idea, a fast prototype, and a real solution for a rescue that needed more than just good intentions.

In early 2020, while volunteering for a newly launched local cat rescue, I designed a simple but impactful prototype database to support daily animal care and record-keeping. I was originally tasked with photographing cats for their online adoption profiles, but after hearing the owner's concerns about identification mix-ups, I proposed and created a tool that could help solve a much bigger operational problem.

## Key Contributions

- Designed a lightweight, visual database featuring a photo, name, weight, and care checklist for each cat, including fields for "ears cleaned," "nails trimmed," and "vitamins given."
- Proactively addressed an operational pain point by creating a system to track care activities and identify cats even if collars were lost or misplaced.
- Built the prototype to be intuitive for non-technical users, providing a clear, expandable framework the rescue could build on as they grew.

## Research Highlights

- Listened closely to real-world user feedback and pain points before proposing a solution, ensuring the prototype directly addressed day-to-day frustrations.
- Focused on clarity, speed, and ease of use, knowing that most users would be volunteers with limited time and varying levels of technical experience.
- Balanced essential data collection with minimal data entry burden to keep the system lightweight and sustainable.

## Reflections

This project showed me how much value comes from combining technical problem-solving with empathy for the people actually using the system. Even a simple prototype can make a real difference when it is designed to fit into the chaos and urgency of real-world operations, not just look good on paper.
