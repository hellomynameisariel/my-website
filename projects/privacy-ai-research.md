# Privacy Policy Research

Finding clear answers across major privacy policies turned out to be a project in endurance full of buried disclosures, circular links, and vague wording.

I independently reviewed 12 major platforms to determine whether they explicitly stated their stance on using customer data for AI model training.  

Out of the 12 companies reviewed, only 5 made clear, unambiguous statements about their practices.

I designed my own reporting method: mapping each company's stance, rating my confidence based on available language, and linking directly to supporting citations.  

The goal wasn't to chase perfect answers â€” it was to deliver clear, usable insights despite deliberate ambiguity.

The final report included a summary table highlighting:
- Each company's explicit disclosure status
- Confidence ratings from 50% to 100%
- Direct citations and notes on ambiguous cases

### Key Skills Applied
- Translating legal and technical language into usable information
- Researching across fragmented and deliberately unclear structures
- Structuring outputs for real-world decision making
- Working independently with minimal supervision
- Balancing depth with clarity under time pressure

### Future Ideas
- Automating periodic re-checks for updates to privacy terms
- Building a lightweight dashboard to track major policy changes over time
