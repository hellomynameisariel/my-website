# Timedrift

Timedrift is a lightweight, real-time team sync tool I built to solve a recurring challenge: keeping distributed teams visually and mentally aligned during collaborative work sprints.

This timer divides the hour into four clean 15-minute blocks, chiming precisely on the quarter-hour, synced to real-world time (:00, :15, :30, :45). It helps teams track time intuitively without disrupting flow, making it easy to stay aware of pacing during focus sessions, standups, retros, or quiet work blocks.

## Why I Built It

In practice, I noticed that even with calendars and scheduled meetings, teams often drifted out of sync during collaborative work. Time "felt" different for everyone, leading to misaligned check-ins, lags, and missed momentum. I created Timedrift as a simple way to keep everyone anchored to the same real-world clock without adding friction.

## Features

- **Real-time block tracking**: Every 15-minute block is clearly shown.
- **Audible chime**: A light chime sounds at the end of each block to gently recenter attention.
- **Adjustable visual clock**: Easy to resize for small screens or external monitors.
- **Mute and volume controls**: Quick audio toggles for flexible environments.
- **"Pop out" window option**: Minimalist, distraction-free mode.

## How it Reflects My Approach

Timedrift embodies how I approach agile team needs: observing real workflows, identifying low-friction improvements, and building focused solutions that enhance team rhythm without creating new burdens. It shows my preference for clean, practical tools that quietly support collaboration, timing, and accountability.

## Future Enhancements

- Optional block labeling (e.g., "Standup," "Work Session 1")
- Integration with lightweight team boards or goal checklists
- Subtle visual alerts for block transitions

> Timedrift was built for real-world teams, not theoretical sprints. It reflects how I prioritize keeping people connected, even when they're working individually.
