Building great products means listening early and often. Since 2020, I have maintained a consistent five-star rating as a user experience tester on **UserTesting**, a platform that connects businesses with real users to gather real-time feedback on products, apps, and websites. By participating in hundreds of tests, I have helped companies improve their digital experiences based on honest and actionable feedback.

## Key Contributions

- Delivered high-quality user experience feedback for brands including Nike, Wayfair, Sephora, Hallmark, and many others.
- Followed specific on-screen instructions while providing live audio recordings and, when required, screen recordings.
- Specialized in verbalizing my thought process, identifying pain points, suggesting improvements, and highlighting strong UX elements.

## Research Highlights

- Completed usability tests, first-impression studies, app navigation walkthroughs, and checkout flow reviews.
- Balanced the need for structured task completion with freeform insights to give companies a realistic view of user behavior.
- Maintained eligibility for premium and invite-only tests by consistently meeting platform quality standards.

## Reflections

Testing with UserTesting has sharpened my ability to think critically about digital design, customer journeys, and human-computer interaction. Giving live feedback taught me to explain not just what I notice, but why it matters, making me a more thoughtful contributor to user-driven product development.
