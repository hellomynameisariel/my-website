# AI Voice Changer Research and Comparative Testing

Evaluating AI voice changers required a mix of research, trial testing, and direct comparison.

Starting from an initial assignment to explore options, I compiled a vetted list of 16 AI voice changer companies, including key details like links, trial periods, and pricing structures.  
I personally tested 14 of the platforms by uploading a consistent sample audio file to each site and capturing the resulting modified audio for review.

Results were organized into a structured table that included:
- Company names with direct links
- Free trial availability and pricing models
- Notes on functionality, user experience, and overall quality
- Individual audio samples generated from each platform

This project focused on identifying real-world usability rather than relying solely on advertised features. The final deliverable gave a clear side-by-side comparison to inform future selection decisions.
